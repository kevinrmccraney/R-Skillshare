# Quick Markdown 101
## As you can tell, 
### these are different header types;  
#### the more '#'s there are,
##### the smaller the text size

> This is a blockquote, use it whenever you have an important point to make.   

#### Note: You start new lines by inserting __TWO SPACES__ after a word. *Weird, I know*.  

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


### Injuries classification by severity
```{r}
head(nassCDS, 25)
```

## Including Plots

### A box plot describing accidents in 1997 and vehicle speeds

```{r accidentsIn1997}
accidents97_plot
```

### A box plot describing accidents in 1997 and vehicle speeds  

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r accidentsIn1997echo, echo=FALSE}
accidents97_plot
```



###A stacked bar plot to visualize the injury severity for female drivers/passengers:
```{r}
injurySeverityPlot
```
